## 🎯 Mission

VOUCH solves the "Experience Paradox" for university students: you can't get a job without experience, and you can't get experience without a job. We offer simulated, real-world projects from actual companies, allowing students to build a verifiable "Proof-of-Work" portfolio that supersedes the traditional resume.

## 👥 Target Segments
